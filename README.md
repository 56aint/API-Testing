This little project has been created to  document some basic performance Testing of a few of my apps and website.
More updates will come...



Note: ``` Execution modes to run k6 tests as part of the CI process can be done like this locally on the CI server. And also to monitor how performance changes overtime across different releases, a solution to this can be setup locally or you can simply create an account to work with k6 cloud.
